# numerical-modulation-demodulation
This is a Matlab project which consists of modulating a signal and then demodulate it using using 3 differents methods.
The first one consists of an energy detection applied to respectively a high-pass filter and a low-pass filter (implemented in codes/mod_demod_filtrage.m)
The second one consists of a FSK demodulation (Frequence Shift Keying) accordingly to the french norm V21 (implemented in codes/mod_demod_v21.m)
The third one consists of a FSK demodulation with carrier phase error management (implemented in codes/mod_demod_v21_gestion.m)

This project was realized during my engineering studies in Digital Sciences at ENSEEIHT.
